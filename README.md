Disable Speculative Pre-connections, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disable-speculative-pre-connec/)

To improve loading speeds, Firefox will open predictive connections to sites when the user hovers their mouse over thumbnails on the New Tab Page or the user starts to search in the Search Bar, or in the search field on the Home or the New Tab Page. [1]

This plugin cleanly disables speculative pre-connections.
